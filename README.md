# Ex-02-Outlier-Detection-and-Removal


# AIM:

To read the given data and perform data cleaning and save the cleaned data to a file

# EXPLANATION:

Outliers are extreme values that differ from most other data points in a dataset. They can have a big impact on your statistical analyses and skew the results of any hypothesis tests. Itâ€™s important to carefully identify potential outliers in your dataset and deal with them in an appropriate manner for accurate results.

# ALGORITHM:

# STEP-1:

Read the given data.

# STEP-2:

Get the information about the data.

# STEP-3:

Detect the outliers in the given datasets.

# STEP-4:

Remove the outliers from the given datasets by using outlier handling techniques.

# STEP-5:

Save the Cleaned data to the file.

# CODE:

# BHP dataset:

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import seaborn as sns

from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()

df=pd.read_csv("bhp.csv")

df

# Remove outliers using IQR and Get a new Dataframe:

q1=df['price_per_sqft'].quantile(0.25)

q3=df['price_per_sqft'].quantile(0.75)

IQR=q3-q1

print("First quantile:",q1," Third quantile:",q3," IQR: ",IQR,"\n")

lower=q1-1.5*IQR

upper=q3+1.5*IQR

outliers=df[(df['price_per_sqft']>=lower)&(df['price_per_sqft']<=upper)]

print("Outliers: \n")

print(outliers)

# Using zscore of 3 to remove outliers:

from scipy.stats import zscore

z=outliers[(zscore(outliers['price_per_sqft'])<3)]

print("Cleaned Data: \n")

print(z)

# Height_Weight dataset:

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import seaborn as sns

from google.colab import files

uploaded = files.upload()

df=pd.read_csv("height_weight.csv")

df

# Using IQR detect weight outliers and print them:

q1=df['weight'].quantile(0.25)

q3=df['weight'].quantile(0.75)

IQR=q3-q1

print("First quantile:",q1," Third quantile:",q3," IQR: ",IQR,"\n")

lower=q1-1.5*IQR

upper=q3+1.5*IQR

outliers=df[(df['weight']>=lower)&(df['weight']<=upper)]

print("Outliers: \n")

print(outliers)

# Using IQR, detect height outliers and print them:

q1=df['height'].quantile(0.25)

q3=df['height'].quantile(0.75)

IQR=q3-q1

print("First quantile:",q1," Third quantile:",q3," IQR: ",IQR,"\n")

lower=q1-1.5*IQR

upper=q3+1.5*IQR

outliers=df[(df['height']>=lower)&(df['height']<=upper)]

print("Outliers: \n")

print(outliers)

# RESULT:

Thus the outliers were detected and removed from the given datasets by using outlier handling
